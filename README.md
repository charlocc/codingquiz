When you click the "Start Quiz" button - a timer will begin counting down from 120 seconds, and the first quiz question, and its corresponding answer choices will appear. 
When you answer the first question, the second question will appear. 
If you answer incorrectly, time will be deducted (lowering your score). 
Once you have answered all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over. 
When the game is over, then you can save your initials and see your score.
